# Capture Login Credentials Using Wireshark & Netsniff-ng in Kali Linux 

## What are Wireshark and Netsniff-ng?

What is netsniff?

Netsniff-ng is a tool for packet capture and modification. It enables users to monitor and control network traffic, which makes it helpful in a variety of network-related assignments and evaluations of security.

What is Wireshark? 

Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer. It enables users to collect and evaluate data flowing back and forth across a network in real-time. Also works as an essential tool for network administrators, security professionals, and developers to troubleshoot network difficulties, study protocols, and uncover security vulnerabilities. 

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in network security and packet analysis. Specifically, the project aims to understand how login credentials can be intercepted over unencrypted networks using packet sniffing tools like Wireshark and Netsniff-ng. 

## Problem Solving 

By utilizing packet sniffing tools like Wireshark and Netsniff-ng, the project seeks to demonstrate how login credentials can be intercepted and analyzed, highlighting vulnerabilities in network security. 

## Challenges Faced 

Some challenges faced during the project include understanding network protocols, filtering out irrelevant traffic, ensuring ethical and legal use of packet sniffing tools, and interpreting captured data accurately.


## Benefits and Flaws 

### Benefits:
- Understand the risks associated with transmitting sensitive information over unencrypted networks.
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities related to credential exposure.
- Maintaining network integrity and security

### Flaws:
- Ethical and legal considerations surrounding the interception of login credentials
- May provide a narrow perspective on network security, overlooking other crucial aspects such as encryption, access control, and intrusion detection.

## Recommendation: 

I would recommend it to testers, network administrators, and system administrators, provided that appropriate legal and ethical measures are taken. 
This includes:

- Emphasizing the ethical conduct and responsible use of packet sniffing tools
- Ensuring compliance with relevant privacy laws and organizational policies
- Obtaining explicit authorization before conducting any packet sniffing activities
- Protecting captured data through secure handling practices
- Providing education and training on the proper use of packet sniffing tools
- Encouraging ongoing monitoring and review of network traffic to detect and address security vulnerabilities
